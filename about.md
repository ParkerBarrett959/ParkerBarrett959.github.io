# About Me

I'm a software engineer with over four years of experience working on nonlinear state estimation, GNSS-denied navigation, tracking, and sensor fusion algorithms, primarily for robotics and autonomous systems. My work bridges theory and application, focusing on turning complex mathematical models into real-time, reliable software that runs on robots in the real-world.

My education background is in Aerospace Engieering with an emphasis on vehicle dynamics, controls and state estimation. I also have a deep understanding of applied mathematics, particularly in numerical methods, probability and statistics linear algebra and differential equations.

On the software side, I specialize in modern C++, and take pride in writing efficient, clean, and well-architected code. I also have experience using Python and Matlab, typically for algorithm prototypes and analysis/automation, along with some Rust.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m an avid hiker and fitness enthusiast. I enjoy spending time outdoors, exploring trails, and staying active.
